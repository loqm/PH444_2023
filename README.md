## PH 421 Photonics: Student Projects (2022)
### **Instructor: Professor Anshuman Kumar, Physics Department, IIT Bombay**

Course PH 444: Electromagnetic Theory

tl;dr 1: Jupyter notebooks for each of the (numbered) projects below are available in the accompanying folder.

tl;dr 2: A YouTube playlist where each student group explains their work is available here: [https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLBAf4P2YTnSU7mAci2482dBqK0Q5sZs7X](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLBAf4P2YTnSULzOzvY8HyC1Y8Miilz_rT)

- Project topics have been decided by the instructor keeping the match with our course content in mind. No changes are permitted in the project topics as of now.
- Total strength is 64, so we will have 12 groups of 5 people each and 1 group of 4 people

Requirements:

- A 1 hour long pre-recorded presentation by each team, which should be made available to the entire class on microsoft teams before your live presentation date
- A 25 minute shorter live presentation during the class:
  - Giving a broader picture of the work
  - Explaining the specific calculations/plots you reproduced
  - Live iPython notebook demo reproducing the plots
- In lieu of a traditional project report, an [executable paper](https://www.nature.com/articles/s42005-020-00403-4) (iPython notebook is strongly encouraged) reproducing the calculations/plots/derivations needs to be supplied to the instructor for evaluation
- In both the presentations as well as the executable paper, details of the contributions of individual group members to the project should be clearly spelt out.
- Evaluation is based on the following criteria:
  - Understanding of the topic: breadth and depth (eg. via reading cross-references)
  - Quality of presentation (eg. motivation, breaking down the problem, conclusion)
  - Reproducing parts of the paper (i.e. your executable paper (iPython notebook) demo) -- this component has the highest weightage
